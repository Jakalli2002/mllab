# mllab
mllab is my personal learning repository for implementing machine learning concepts from scratch. It contains small experiments, exercises and mini-projects based on my 3 month ML roadmap, designed to build a strong foundation in ML and later AI. This project also supports my preparation for future roles and my Bachelor’s thesis
